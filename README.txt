 Full version debuted at Birmingham’s Alys Stephens Performing Arts Center Presents Lux Somnia: Light Dreams.

 Interactive video artwork featuring the Xbox Kinect. The Kinect senses the viewer/player’s placement within
 a set arena, makes a decision based on the direct and amount of the viewer’s movement, and plays a 
 corresponding video of a woman moving. This gives the illusion that the woman is interacting with the viewer. 
 This careful give and take behavior mirrors the careful back and forth moves carried out between two people 
 during courtship; an aggressive or aloof movement causes the figure to run.

 Arena of the Doe was created with C# and Microsoft's Kinect SDK v1.6.
